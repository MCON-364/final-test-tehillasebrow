/**
 * Analyzing incidents from an operational incident tracking system.
 *
 * An incident management system tracks operational issues after they are reported
 * and worked on. Each incident has information such as its category, priority,
 * whether it has been closed, and how many minutes it took to close.
 * The goal of this class is to turn a list of individual incidents into
 * one aggregated summary.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - The constructor receives the incidents to analyze.
 * - The original list must not be modified by this class.
 * - getClosedCount() returns how many incidents have been closed.
 * - getAverageTimeToClose() returns the average closing time for closed incidents only.
 * - getCountByCategory() returns how many incidents belong to each category.
 * - getCriticalOpenIncidents() returns open incidents with high priority.
 * - Use streams to express the data processing logic.
 * - Do not use loops.
