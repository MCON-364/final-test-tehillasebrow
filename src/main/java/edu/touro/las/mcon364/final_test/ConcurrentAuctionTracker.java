/**
 * Concurrent Auction Tracker (ConcurrentSkipListSet + ExecutorService)
 *
 * Scenario: an online auction platform receives bid submissions from many bidders
 * at the same time. The tracker must always reflect the current top bids in
 * sorted order (highest first) and must be safe when read and written concurrently.
 *
 *  Requirements:
 * - submitBid(entry) adds a BidEntry thread-safely and counts the submission.
 * - getTopN(n) returns the top n BidEntry objects as an immutable list, highest first.
 * - getTotalBids() returns the number of times submitBid has been called.
 * - runSimulation(bidders, bidsEach) uses an ExecutorService to have each bidder
 *   submit bidsEach random bids concurrently, then shuts down the pool and waits.
 *
 * Do not use synchronized blocks. Rely on concurrent collections and atomic variables to ensure thread safety.
